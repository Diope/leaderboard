## Leaderboard
#### Is it even really a leaderboard?

I have been learning Meteor.js as my secondary framework of choice in addition to Rails being my main area of focus.
At first I found Meteor.js to be extremely confusing and borderline nonsensical coming from Rails. I went through two separate
meteor books/tutorials and by the end of the second one it made more sense. I have come to grasp the basic concepts of Meteor.js, and by proxy I started to understand how Javascript.

This app is very very simple. It allows uers to log in/log out via Meteor's `accounts-password` package and create entries and add or take away 5 points.
While the app itself is very simple it does touch over several main points of the framework and is a good foundation to learning more. My plan at this point is to create more rails apps then create a Meteor.js version of that same application.
